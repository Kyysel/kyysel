# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Anthime
Attracted by **Music** and **Video Games Development** I try to learn various programming languages and experiment to find out what I like.
 
### Technologies and Tools
Python, Java, Javascript, C/C++, Unity/C#, SQL
<br />

### Projects
I have been making games (mostly game jams) since february 2020. All the finished games are available on my [Itch.io page](https://kyysel.itch.io).
I also like spending time doing very short projects on the fly when I have a dumb idea.
