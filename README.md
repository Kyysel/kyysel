# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Anthime
I am a Computer Science student, attracted by **Music** and **Video Games Development**, I am learning various programming languages and experimenting to find out what I like.
 
### Technologies and Tools
Python, Java, Javascript, C/C++, Unity/C#, SQL, HTML/CSS
<br />

### Projects
My projects are currently private or not on git.
I have been making games (mostly game jams) since february 2020. All the finished games are available on my [Itch.io page](https://kyysel.itch.io).
I also like spending time doing very short projects on the fly when I have a dumb idea.
<br />
My school projects are on my school's GitLab and are mostly private (because of team issues). Here is a link to my [Gitlab profile](https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/E20A976P).
